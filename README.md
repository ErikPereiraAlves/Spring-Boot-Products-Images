# Scenario:

We have a Product Entity with One to Many relationship with Image entity

Product also has a Many to One relationship with itself (Many Products to one Parent Product)

1ยบ Build a Restful service using JAX-RS to perform CRUD operations on a Product resource using Image as a sub-resource of Product.

2ยบ Your API classes should perform these operations:

1) Create, update and delete products
2) Create, update and delete images
3) Get all products excluding relationships (child products, images)
4) Get all products including specified relationships (child product and/or images)
5) Same as 3 using specific product identity
6) Same as 4 using specific product identity
7) Get set of child products for specific product
8) Get set of images for specific product


3ยบ Build JPA/Hibernate classes using annotations to persist these objects in the database

Technical Specification:

1) Maven must be used to build, run tests and start the application.
2) The tests must be started with the mvn test command.
3) The application must start with a Maven command: mvn exec:java, mvn jetty:run, mvn spring-boot:run, etc.
4) The application must have a stateless API and use a database to store data.
5) An embedded in-memory database should be used: either H2, HSQL, SQLite or Derby.
6) The database and tables creation should be done by Maven or by the application.
7) You must provide BitBucket username. A free BitBucket account can be created at http://bitbucket.org. Once finished, you must give the user ac-recruitment read permission on your repository so that you can be evaluated.
8) You must provide a README.txt (plain text) or a README.md (Markdown) file at the root of your repository, explaining:
- How to compile and run the application with an example for each call.
- How to run the suite of automated tests.
- Mention anything that was asked but not delivered and why, and any additional comments.

=====================================================================

# Solution:

* Stack applied: Spring boot maven application using embedded H2 database.

## Please note:
        I created the tables a bit different. For both Product and Image, there are more columns. For image specifically i used a column called url for the image's location.
        And didn't use the column Type, as i used URL column. The reason is that I only saw the DER from the recruiters email afterwards. But i strongly believe my solution is even more complete than
        the required example.


### NOTE: parent products should have its parentProductId set to null. Example:

            INSERT INTO PRODUCT (PRODUCT_ID, PRODUCT_PARENT_ID, PRODUCT_NAME,PRODUCT_DESC,PRODUCT_PRICE,PRODUCT_CREATED_TS,PRODUCT_UPDATED_TS)
            VALUES (1,null,'Apple Iphone','Apple Smartphones', 0.0,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());


* How to Run and Test:


1- Running Spring Boot Application

* We can run the spring boot application using the following maven command.

    mvn spring-boot:run

* Run tests:
    mvn test


2- H2 Web Console

    I configured the H2 Web Console to be accessible via the /console path. You can access the console via http://localhost:8080/console  (user id:<ac> )

3- Integration test using Postman

    3.1 - Product(s)

    * URI containing  .../exclude/..  means results with no children relationship

    * URI containing .../include/.. means results with children relationship

    GET:
        http://localhost:8080/store/api/v1/products/exclude                     (Gets all products excluding relationships)
        http://localhost:8080/store/api/v1/products/include                     (Gets all products including relationships)
        http://localhost:8080/store/api/v1/products/exclude/{product_id}        (Gets specific product excluding relationships)
        http://localhost:8080/store/api/v1/products/include/{product_id}        (Gets specific product including relationships)

    POST:
        http://localhost:8080/store/api/v1/products/

        example:
            {"productParentId":1,"productName":"Smartphone postman","productDesc":"controller integration tests for product","productPrice":100.0,"productCreatedTs":"2018-02-12","productUpdatedTs":"2018-02-12","images":[],"products":[]}

    PUT:
        http://localhost:8080/store/api/v1/products/

        example:  {"productParentId":1,"productName":"Smartphone postman","productDesc":"MODIFIED","productPrice":100.0,"productCreatedTs":"2018-02-12","productUpdatedTs":"2018-02-12","images":[],"products":[]}


    DELETE:
         http://localhost:8080/store/api/v1/products/{product_id}


    3.2 - Image(s)

    GET:
        http://localhost:8080/store/api/v1/images/product/{product_id}          (Get all images for a given product)

        http://localhost:8080/store/api/v1/images/{image_id}                    (Get specific image by its id)


    POST:
        http://localhost:8080/store/api/v1/images/{product_id}                  (in order to create an image, one need to have it associated to an existing product)

        example:   {"url":"www.post-test.com/image.png"}


    PUT:
        http://localhost:8080/store/api/v1/images/

        example:    {"imageId": 4,"url":"www.post-UPDATED.com/image.png"}

    DELETE:
        http://localhost:8080/store/api/v1/images/{image_id}
